# Introduction
 
Hi, I'm Phil ðŸ‘‹ this is my personal collection of recipes.
Some of these are my own, some I grabbed from the web and customized, and some others go way back and have been passed down through the generations.

Dishes are from all over the world, although there is a minor focus on Austrian, Russian, and Ukrainian cuisine due to my heritage and family background.

## You want your own site like this?

This site is [open-source](https://nextra.site). I used [Nextra](https://nextra.site) to build it. It's a static site generator that uses Markdown files for content and is typically used for documentation of developer tools and libraries.

You are non-tech and don't know how to set this up? You can [contact me here](https://twitter.com/philipp_parzer). If I have time, I can help you.
